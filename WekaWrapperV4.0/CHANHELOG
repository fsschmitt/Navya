DELETED

  -- the feature selection layer

  -- the missing values layer

ADDED:

   -- Computes best measures:
          Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F measure

   -- Uses experimenter to get all individual values of CV and computes the 
      mean and standard deviation for each measure

   -- each algorithm stores the LOG in a different file that is gzipped before the next starts
